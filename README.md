Next.js Project
This is a Next.js project starter template that allows you to quickly set up and run a development server. The project comes with pre-configured optimizations like automatic font loading and hot-reloading for efficient development.

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, follow the steps below to start the development server:

Run the Development Server

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application running.
